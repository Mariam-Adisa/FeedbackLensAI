# FeedbackLensAI

FeedbackLens AI is an AI-powered sentiment analysis tool that transforms raw product reviews into actionable insights for e-commerce sellers. It uses NLP to classify sentiment, extract recurring customer themes, summarize feedback, and generate improvement recommendations.
Built with Glide and synthetic review data, this project demonstrates practical application of AI for CX optimization and product decision-making, and serves as a strong portfolio example of concept prototyping and product thinking.

**Features**
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Automatically classifies reviews as positive, neutral, or negative.  
- **Feedback Summaries**: Compresses 100s of reviews into short, digestible insights.  
- **Theme Extraction**: Identifies recurring issues (delivery, product quality, packaging, size, etc.).  
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Uses AI to suggest what sellers should improve or optimize.  
- **Dashboard View**: Clean interface showing sentiment trends and customer themes.  
- **Review Upload Simulation**: Uses synthetic e-commerce review dataset for demo purposes.

**Problem Statement**
E-commerce sellers struggle to manually read, interpret, and act on thousands of product reviews.  
This leads to:
- Missed customer pain points  
- Slow response to emerging issues  
- Difficulty improving product quality  
- No centralized view of customer sentiment trends  

Even small sellers often drown in data but lack tools to extract meaning from it.

**Solution**
FeedbackLens AI solves this by using **NLP and LLM-based analysis** to automatically:
- Process reviews at scale  
- Detect positive/negative sentiment  
- Summarize key insights  
- Highlight recurring themes  
- Provide actionable recommendations a seller can implement  

The result is a simple, accessible AI-powered dashboard that converts customer feedback into product improvement strategies.

**Tech Stack**
- **Glide** → Frontend UI & workflow setup  
- **Glide AI / LLMs** → Sentiment classification, summarization, recommendations  
- **Synthetic Review Data** → Simulated e-commerce dataset  
- **Google Sheets / Glide Database** → Storage layer  
- **Figma** → UI design mockups  
- **GitHub** → Version control & portfolio hosting  

**How It Works**
1. Upload or simulate product reviews  
2. AI analyzes sentiment and identifies key themes  
3. Dashboard displays results (charts, summaries, issue clusters)  
4. AI generates recommendations for product improvement  
5. Seller uses insights to enhance customer experience  

**Demo Data**
Since this is a portfolio prototype, all reviews used in testing are **synthetic** and generated for demonstration purposes.

**Future Improvements**
**Direct Integration** with Amazon, Shopify & Jumia review APIs  
**Advanced Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis** (e.g., categorize sentiment by product features)  
**Trend Analytics** (weekly, monthly sentiment shifts)  
**Instant Alerts** when negative sentiment spikes  
**Category-Level Benchmarking** (compare similar products)  
**Multi-language Review Support**  
**Auto-generated Weekly Insight Reports (PDF/CSV)**  

**Status**
This is an MVP prototype created for the **30-Day AI Building Challenge** to showcase rapid product prototyping skills and practical AI application as a Product Manager.
