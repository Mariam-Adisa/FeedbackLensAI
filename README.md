## 🧩 **Problem Statement**
E-commerce sellers struggle to manually read, interpret, and act on thousands of product reviews.  
This leads to:
- Missed customer pain points  
- Slow response to emerging issues  
- Difficulty improving product quality  
- No centralized view of customer sentiment trends  

Even small sellers often drown in data but lack tools to extract meaning from it.

ReviewSense AI solves this by using **NLP and LLM-based analysis** to automatically:
- Process reviews at scale  
- Detect positive/negative sentiment  
- Summarize key insights  
- Highlight recurring themes  
- Provide actionable recommendations a seller can implement  

The result is a simple, accessible AI-powered dashboard that converts customer feedback into product improvement strategies.
