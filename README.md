# FeedbackLensAI
FeedbackLens AI is a rapid prototype that analyzes product reviews using NLP to uncover sentiment, summarize customer feedback, and suggest data-driven improvements. Built with Glide and synthetic data for portfolio demonstration.
AI-Powered Sentiment Analyzer for E-commerce Product Reviews  

FeedbackLens AI is a lightweight NLP-driven tool that transforms large volumes of customer reviews into clear, actionable insights. It detects sentiment, extracts common pain points, summarizes feedback, and generates AI-powered improvement suggestions, helping e-commerce sellers quickly understand what customers love, what frustrates them, and what to fix next.

Built using **Glide**, **LLM-based sentiment analysis**, and **synthetic e-commerce review data**, this project demonstrates rapid prototyping, practical AI application, and strong product-thinking for portfolio and concept validation.

## 🚀 **Features**
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Automatically classifies reviews as positive, neutral, or negative.  
- **Feedback Summaries**: Compresses 100s of reviews into short, digestible insights.  
- **Theme Extraction**: Identifies recurring issues (delivery, product quality, packaging, size, etc.).  
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Uses AI to suggest what sellers should improve or optimize.  
- **Dashboard View**: Clean interface showing sentiment trends and customer themes.  
- **Review Upload Simulation**: Uses synthetic e-commerce review dataset for demo purposes.

## 🧩 **Problem Statement**
E-commerce sellers struggle to manually read, interpret, and act on thousands of product reviews.  
This leads to:
- Missed customer pain points  
- Slow response to emerging issues  
- Difficulty improving product quality  
- No centralized view of customer sentiment trends  

Even small sellers often drown in data but lack tools to extract meaning from it.

## 💡 **Solution**
FeedbackLens AI solves this by using **NLP and LLM-based analysis** to automatically:
- Process reviews at scale  
- Detect positive/negative sentiment  
- Summarize key insights  
- Highlight recurring themes  
- Provide actionable recommendations a seller can implement  

The result is a simple, accessible AI-powered dashboard that converts customer feedback into product improvement strategies.
